          George Arthur Ragan was born in Los Angeles, California on June 24,
          1981. He first met future band mate J-Dog when he was very young, but
          they didn't like each other when they first met. However, years later,
          they ended up in the same band. He used to date a girl named Carly,
          along with a few others before meeting a woman named Asia. They have a
          daughter together, named Ava Ragan and are married since January 19,
          2018. Asia recently announced on her Instagram that they are going to
          have another baby in November. He lived in California almost all his
          life, most recently in Huntington Beach, before ultimately moving to
          Nashville, Tennessee with his family. Band Position He is typically a
          vocalist doing raps in more serious, sad and/or angry songs. Despite
          this, he has rapped in less mature songs like No. 5 and One More
          Bottle. In I'll Be There and Sing, he does clean vocals for the first
          time (for the band). His favorite song off of American Tragedy is
          S.C.A.V.A... He posted on Twitter in January of 2015 that his favorite
          Hollywood Undead song is Outside. He also claims I'll Be There to be
          one of his favorites from Day of the Dead along with Does Everybody in
          the World Have to Die. During an interview with Impericon in 2017, he
          listed I Don't Wanna Die and Young as some of his favorite songs. His
          favorite songs from V are Your Life, Renegade and Pray (Put 'Em in the
          Dirt).

        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Masks</h4>
        <article class="mb-4 mx-4 p-2">
          Hollywood Undead Johnny's first mask in 2006 was a white goalie mask
          with huge, symmetrical black splatters dropping from its eyes. The
          splatters were flowing towards to the sides of the mask. The mouth was
          covered with the regular silver duct tape. Later, he changed it to a
          golden mask. He kept the black splatter but it wasn't symmetrical
          anymore and flowed straight towards the mouth. The mouth was covered
          by two black warning tapes that said "Time Again" in red. Swan Songs
          Johnny took a new approach to his mask and made it a sky blue shade
          with a white "3" on the left side of his face. There was a big black
          butterfly on his right eye, and four orange butterflies near it. He
          also had especially big holes cut for his eyes. American Tragedy
          Johnny's mask is now colored with a lighter shade of blue. The mask no
          longer has the mouth cut and the size of eye cuts have also reduced.
          The butterflies are slightly more detailed, with the biggest butterfly
          also having a skull on its left wing. The "3" on the left side is much
          larger and takes up most of the left side of the mask. The "3" also
          lights up. Notes from the Underground Johnny elected to make the mask
          look more human-like, as well as somewhat of an artifact. There is a
          chiseled pattern, as well as minor artificial dust. It is colored with
          a darker shade of blue. The "3" on the mask lights up in white and it
          remains large. The small monarch butterflies are gone and the
          previously black butterfly now takes away the majority of mask's right
          side. It also lights up in a bright yellow. Day of the Dead Johnny's
          mask looks cleaner and more streamlined to his previous mask. The
          butterflies were moved to the left side of the mask, they are light
          blue on the whitish background. A continuous pattern of the "Dove and
          Grenade" and the butterflies can also be seen there. The cracks on the
          mask have been reduced to simple scratches. The "3" on the left side
          is silver. The upper left-hand side and the lower right-hand side of
          the mask also seem to have their colors washed out giving them an
          almost white color. He also has a teardrop under his right eye in a
          slightly darker color. It no longer lights up like it did in the
          previous two renditions. V Like most members of the band, Johnny has
          also replaced his mask with a chrome one. His new mask is still very
          much detailed, much more so than the other members'. His mask is
          covered in three different kinds of carvings of butterflies. He now
          has two threes on his mask on both sides of his face. Johnny has a
          silver mask with blue threes, a golden mask with black threes, and a
          red mask with white threes.
