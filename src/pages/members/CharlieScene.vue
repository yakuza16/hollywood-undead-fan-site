        Biography Personal Background Jordon Terrell was born in Burbank,
        California on September 3, 1985. He knew future bandmate Funny Man from
        a young age, and they hung out very regularly growing up. Charlie is
        featured in almost every song from the band and usually raps about
        partying, girls, drugs, drinks and kicking ass, although he has also
        written verses about emotional, strong thoughts. He is classified as the
        "gangster" of the band. He appeared at the Family Values festival, which
        also featured Jonathan Davis and his band Korn. His favorite song of
        theirs is Bullet. He came with the idea in a cab when he was buying a
        suit for a wedding. Most of the members disliked it at first because it
        wasn't their usual style. His favorite song from Day of the Dead is War
        Child with Take Me Home being a close second. His favorite song from V
        is Broken Record.

        Masks Charlie Scene's masks have never truly been "masks". Instead, he
        uses a bandana. The reason for this is because he would rather wear
        something comfortable, like cloth, than a solid mask. Hollywood Undead
        Initially, Charlie had no money for a mask so he simply wore a Del Taco
        bag as a mask with holes for eyes and sunglasses. He didn't like it so
        much because it wasn't comfortable, so he changed it later in time. Swan
        Songs Charlie wore a black bandana and sunglasses. The bandana had a
        white city style drawing with the letters "LA" stylized on it in the
        shape of an AK-47. The top of his bandana read "Charles P. Scene".
        Desperate Measures Charlie's bandana had "Charlie Scene" written on it
        instead. American Tragedy Charlie's bandana remained the same as the one
        he was wearing during Desperate Measures, only with inverted colors.
        Notes from the Underground Charlie's bandana is the same as the one he
        was wearing during Desperate Measures but the black is replaced with
        charcoal grey. Day of the Dead Charlie Scene's bandana looks really
        close to his Desperate Measures bandana. The image on the mask appears
        to be slightly different. It still features the AK-47 with "HU" written
        in it, the city seems to be in ruins, similar to the Day of the Dead
        single cover, and a thick cloud of smoke is drifting above it. The color
        of the bandana is black, instead of grey. V Charlie still wears a
        bandana, but this time without images. He no longer has his name on top.
        On top he has the word Hollywood with his name under it, now being
        broken up in two lines but retaining the previously used font. Under his
        name, he has "LA" written stylized with the two letters merging into
        each other. Charlie has a black bandana with golden letters, a blue
        bandana with silver letters, and a red bandana with white letters.
