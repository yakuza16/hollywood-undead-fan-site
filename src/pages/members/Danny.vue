      <h3>Danny</h3>
      Bio Danny is one of the current vocalists for Hollywood Undead, replacing
      Deuce since early 2010. He began to tour with them prior to his official
      introduction to the band in mid-2008, filling in for Deuce while he was
      absent. He has stated that his top three songs off of American Tragedy are
      My Town, Hear Me Now, and, I Don't Wanna Die. However, he said it was hard
      to decide as he loves all of the songs. His favorite song from Day of the
      Dead is War Child, mostly because of the live performances. His favorite
      song from V is Ghost Beach.

      Masks Desperate Measures Danny was touring with the band since mid-2008.
      On tours, he wore two gold masks with black paint splatter on it. American
      Tragedy When he joined the band, Danny's mask was metallic gold with a
      Latin cross on the left eye. The right side of the mouth also had a small,
      hardly noticeable grin. Notes from the Underground Danny's mask is similar
      to his old mask. It's still gold but less metallic. The Latin cross
      appears to be inverted and is made of bullet casings. The bullets are 6.5
      Grendel. The darkening splatter has returned and it varies in color. The
      right side of the mouth still has the grin, but it's more noticeable now.
      Day of the Dead Danny's mask is now covered with a golden chainmail making
      it hard to distinguish its facial features. Underneath the chainmail, the
      mask is black with a cross painted with bright gold around its left eye.
      The molding seems to be less angular and more rounded compared to the
      previous mask, although the mouth is hard to see, it also retains some of
      its aesthetic features. The strap used to fasten it to Danny's head also
      seems to have a chainmail aesthetic. It also seems that the mask
      represents a burlap sack that was used to put on somebody's head before
      execution. V Like most members of the band, Danny has also replaced his
      mask with a chrome one. The mask has one color and retains his signature
      smirk. The cross is no longer a physical attachment to the mask and is
      instead painted on and designed to look like graffiti. Danny has a golden
      mask with a black cross, a silver mask with a blue cross, and a red mask
      with a white cross.
