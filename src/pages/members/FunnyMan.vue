          <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-2">Personal Background</h3>
          Funny Man is a big live favorite of the band due to his lively
          performances and crowd hyping. He has been known to jump into the
          crowd, often be shirtless and occasionally not wear pants. Although he
          isn't as frequently featured on songs that much like Charlie, J-Dog or
          Johnny his songs are about partying, drinking, women, and having a
          good time. He very rarely appears on serious tracks. His favorite song
          from V is Cashed Out. Foundation Funny Man joined the band soon after
          it was created by J-Dog and Deuce and provided backing and the
          occasional verse on many of their early songs. In the early life of
          the band, he wore a black cloth mask that covered his whole face.
          Before joining, he was the "groupie" of Johnny's previous band, 3
          Tears, being given the title through turning up to all of their
          concerts. During Swan Songs, Funny Man was regularly featured in songs
          providing backing vocals. He is featured on nine songs doing rapping
          and most other songs providing backing.

        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Masks</h4>
        <article class="mb-4 mx-4 p-2">
          Hollywood Undead Funny Man's 2006 mask was a black mesh mask on which
          he usually wore sunglasses. Swan Songs Funny Man wore a black mask
          with three dots on his right side, and his initials "FM" on the other,
          written in yellow. The mask had a passive facial expression and the
          overall look of a gorilla's face. American Tragedy During his time
          with his Swan Songs mask, Funny Man grew to dislike wearing masks, so
          he returned to his black mesh fabric. On the left cheek, the mask has
          an ironed badge of a screaming skull with two swords and his initials,
          "FM" along with the word "undead" on the top. It closely resembles the
          Oakland Raiders' logo. The three dots on the right side have also
          returned in silver but now it has two on the top and one on the
          bottom. Notes from the Underground Funny Man's mask looks much like a
          mask of a luchador (Mexican wrestler). It is black with a silver
          gorilla face as a reference to his nickname King Kong. Just like the
          previous masks, this one features his initials "FM", now moved to his
          forehead and the three dots on the left. It was a cloth mask with two
          white laces that had "King Kong" written on them. Day of the Dead
          During the 2014 tours Funny Man started to dislike his new mask, so he
          went back wearing his former one from American Tragedy. However,
          instead of a badge, the mask now has a silver "LA" written on it with
          the lower part of the L being the A's horizontal bar. The three dots
          returned to their original arrangement. The mask also lacks some of
          the finer details from the American Tragedy mask, such as the thin
          mesh covering the face of the mask, and being a bit smaller, as it
          does not extend down the neck but ends just below the chin, like the
          Notes from the Underground mask. V Like most members of the band,
          Funny Man has also replaced his mask with a chrome one, although he
          previously stated that he disliked wearing masks. His new mask is
          reminiscent of a regular goalie mask with dozens of small holes, a
          prominent forehead and a nose that faces inwards. He retained his
          three signature dots. Funny Man has a black mask, red mask, and a blue
          mask with the three dots using the secondary colors for each.
