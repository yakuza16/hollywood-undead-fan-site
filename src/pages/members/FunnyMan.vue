      <h1>Funny Man</h1>
      Bio Funny Man is a big live favorite of the band due to his lively
      performances and crowd hyping. He has been known to jump into the crowd,
      often be shirtless and occasionally not wear pants. Although he isn't as
      frequently featured on songs that much like Charlie, J-Dog or Johnny his
      songs are about partying, drinking, women, and having a good time. He very
      rarely appears on serious tracks. His favorite song from V is Cashed Out.
      Foundation Funny Man joined the band soon after it was created by J-Dog
      and Deuce and provided backing and the occasional verse on many of their
      early songs. In the early life of the band, he wore a black cloth mask
      that covered his whole face. Before joining, he was the "groupie" of
      Johnny's previous band, 3 Tears, being given the title through turning up
      to all of their concerts. During Swan Songs, Funny Man was regularly
      featured in songs providing backing vocals. He is featured on nine songs
      doing rapping and most other songs providing backing.

      Masks Hollywood Undead Funny Man's 2006 mask was a black mesh mask on
      which he usually wore sunglasses. Swan Songs Funny Man wore a black mask
      with three dots on his right side, and his initials "FM" on the other,
      written in yellow. The mask had a passive facial expression and the
      overall look of a gorilla's face. American Tragedy During his time with
      his Swan Songs mask, Funny Man grew to dislike wearing masks, so he
      returned to his black mesh fabric. On the left cheek, the mask has an
      ironed badge of a screaming skull with two swords and his initials, "FM"
      along with the word "undead" on the top. It closely resembles the Oakland
      Raiders' logo. The three dots on the right side have also returned in
      silver but now it has two on the top and one on the bottom. Notes from the
      Underground Funny Man's mask looks much like a mask of a luchador (Mexican
      wrestler). It is black with a silver gorilla face as a reference to his
      nickname King Kong. Just like the previous masks, this one features his
      initials "FM", now moved to his forehead and the three dots on the left.
      It was a cloth mask with two white laces that had "King Kong" written on
      them. Day of the Dead During the 2014 tours Funny Man started to dislike
      his new mask, so he went back wearing his former one from American
      Tragedy. However, instead of a badge, the mask now has a silver "LA"
      written on it with the lower part of the L being the A's horizontal bar.
      The three dots returned to their original arrangement. The mask also lacks
      some of the finer details from the American Tragedy mask, such as the thin
      mesh covering the face of the mask, and being a bit smaller, as it does
      not extend down the neck but ends just below the chin, like the Notes from
      the Underground mask. V Like most members of the band, Funny Man has also
      replaced his mask with a chrome one, although he previously stated that he
      disliked wearing masks. His new mask is reminiscent of a regular goalie
      mask with dozens of small holes, a prominent forehead and a nose that
      faces inwards. He retained his three signature dots. Funny Man has a black
      mask, red mask, and a blue mask with the three dots using the secondary
      colors for each.
